<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Like Stars on Earth (Taare Zameen Par)</h3>
<p>This movie is deeply emotional and reflective. It’s about seeing people for who they truly are, not just who society expects them to be. Beyond the story of a child with dyslexia, it’s really about empathy, patience, and how one person’s belief can completely change another’s life. It stays with you because it reminds you to be kinder — especially to those who struggle quietly.</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>This is a powerful story about resilience and dignity in the face of relentless hardship. It captures what it means to keep going when life gives you every reason to quit. The father–son relationship adds emotional weight, making the success feel earned rather than lucky. It resonates strongly if you value perseverance, responsibility, and quiet strength.</p>
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>This film speaks to individuality, purpose, and courage. It challenges rigid systems and encourages people to think for themselves and live authentically. The message — “Carpe Diem” — isn’t about recklessness, but about truly owning your life and voice before it’s too late. It hits especially hard if you value meaning over conformity.</p>
