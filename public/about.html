<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I operate at the intersection of data and depth. With a background in Water Resources and Agrometeorology (Hydrology), I don’t just observe systems, I analyze patterns, interpret signals, and understand the forces shaping environments and outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m constantly evolving. I’m not who I was yesterday and that’s intentional. Growth, refinement, and self-awareness define my journey. I embrace becoming, shifting, and relearning as part of my process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether I’m building structured academic content, analyzing environmental data, or optimizing systems, I move with purpose. I don’t just complete tasks. I design, improve, and elevate them.
